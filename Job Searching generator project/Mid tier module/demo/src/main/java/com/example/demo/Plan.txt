This Spring Boot program provides a simple REST API for managing job postings. 
It defines a Job entity that maps to a jobs table in PostgreSQL, 
with fields such as ID, title, company, description, and link. 
Through a repository interface, the program connects to the database
 using Spring Data JPA, which handles basic operations like saving, 
 finding, and deleting jobs. A controller layer exposes these operations
  as HTTP endpoints, allowing clients to create new jobs, 
  retrieve all or individual jobs, update existing ones, and delete them.
   When the application starts, Spring Boot launches an embedded server, 
   connects to the database, and makes these endpoints available, 
   enabling a full create-read-update-delete (CRUD) workflow for job postings.

 basic function:
 -input job to database
 -retrieve all job in database
 -update exising ones based on id input
 -deleting the job based on id input
